Description of the files:

MATLAB
    - simCooperativeTransport.mlx:
        Dynamics of the robot
        Algorithm parameters: leader, follower
        Obstacles parameters
            It is the main file to setup and start the simulation

    FUNCTIONS
        - constraints.m: get the contraints of the robot wrt the obstacles 
        - costWeights.M: weights for the MPC
        
        - followerCostGradientHessian.m
        - followerMPCandUpdate.m: generate the optimal path for the FOLLOWER
        - followerMPCandUpdateNC.m: same as the prevous but with NL constraints
        - followerNC.m: defines NL constraints for the follower
        
        - getObstacleInfo.m: define the distance and minimum distance from the obstacle and the robot
        - getqiFromShape.m: tries to construct the distance and position of the line tangent to the shape and perpendicular to x0
        - getSbar.m
        - getSdbar.m
        - getTbar.m
        - getTdbar.m
